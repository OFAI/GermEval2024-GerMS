In the open tracks, participants are encouraged to use additional data or models trained on labelled data. These additional labelled data, embeddings or models need to be open source and provided by the participants upon request and if possible via the submission page. Participants submitting in open tracks are only invited to submit a paper for the Shared Task at KONVENS 2024 describing their system, if they also made a submission in a closed track during the Test Phase and compare their approaches in the paper. Due to reproducibility issues, e.g. when including generative LLM such as GPT 3.5, we do not accept papers who solely present approaches for the open tracks.
