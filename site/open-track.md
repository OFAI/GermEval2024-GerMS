# Open Track Competitions


There is an _Open Track_ competition for each of the two subtasks. Please note the following:

* NOTE: we strongly encourage participants to also consider submitting to the [closed track](closed-track.md) 
* In the open tracks, participants are encouraged to use whatever approach they prefer
* Please note that while open track solutions can make use of models or approaches where it is hard or impossible to 
  fully reproduce all components and results, we welcome submissions where as much of the solution is open source and 
  reproducible as possible. 
* Additional labelled data or models or embeddings trained on labelled data are allowed.
  * HOWEVER, additional labelled data, embeddings or models must be publically available as open source or with a creative-commons license.
