# GermEval2024 GerMS - Open Track Competitions


There is an _Open Track_ competition for each of the two subtasks. Please note the following:

* In the open tracks, participants are encouraged to use whatever approach they prefer
* Additional labeld data or models or embeddings trained on labelled data are allowed.
  * HOWEVER, additional labelled data, embeddings or models must be publically available as open source or with a creative-commons license 
* IMPORTANT: Participants submitting in open tracks are only invited to submit a paper for the Shared Task at KONVENS 2024 describing their system, if they also made a submission in a closed track during the Competition Phase. 
* Due to reproducibility issues, e.g. when including results from commercial or closed-source models, we do not accept papers which solely present approaches for the open tracks.
* We do look forward however to find out how the results in the open tracks will compare to the closed track results.
