In the closed tracks, participants agree to use only the annotated data provided within this task to develop their model. No (i) additional data labelled for sexism or misogyn or (ii) additional models trained on data labelled for sexism or misogyny are allowed. Participants having made at least one submission in a closed track during the Test Phase will be invited to submit a paper for the Shared Task at KONVENS 2024 describing their system. If participants also made at least one submission for an open track, they can also include a comparison of their approaches in the paper.
