# Closed Track Competitions

There is a _Closed Track_ competition for each of the two subtasks. Please note the following:

* We strongly encourage submitting to the closed track
* **IMPORTANT**: In the closed tracks, participants agree to use **only** the annotated data provided within this task to develop their model. More specifically:
  * the use of additional data labelled for sexism or misogyn is not allowed
  * the use of pretrained models or embeddings trained on data labelled for sexism or misogyny is not allowed
  * the use of large language models, where the exact training data and, if applicable, fine-tuning steps are not known or reproducible is not allowed
  * the use of other models, ontologies, knowledge bases or similar that contains specific knowledge about sexism / misogyny is not allowed
  * pretrained models like BERT or embeddings are allowed as long as they have not been specifically pre-trained or fine-tuned on sexism/misogyny-specific data other than the data shared for this competition
* If in doubt if your approach is compatible with the closed track requirements, please ask in the competition forum or send an email to the 
  organizers. If you send an email to the organizers you can include information which you might not want to share in the forum which the organizers will 
  keep confidential. 
* **IMPORTANT**: Only fully open-source solutions will be accepted for publication. By submitting to a closed track you certify that the system described in the 
  paper will be made available to the public with an open-source license in a way that makes it possible to repeat your results / submissions.
