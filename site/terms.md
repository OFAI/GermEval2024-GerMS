# Terms and Conditions

**Participation in the competition**: Any interested person may freely participate in the competition. By participating in the competition, you agree to the terms and conditions in their entirety, without amendment or provision. By participating in the competition, you consent to the public release of your scores and submissions at the GermEval-2024 workshop and in the associated proceedings. Participation is understood as any direct or indirect contributions to this site or the shared task organizers, such as, but not limited to: results of automatic scoring programs; manual, qualitative and quantitative assessments of the data submitted; task and systems papers submitted.

**Individual and Team Participation**: Participants may create teams, but participants may not be part of more than one team. Teams and individual participants must create exactly one account to participate in the Codabench competition. Team composition may not be changed once the Test Phase starts. Your system may be named according to the team name provided at the time of submission, or to a suitable shorthand as determined by the task organizers.

**Scoring of submissions**: Submissions may be evaluated with automatic and manual quantitative judgements, qualitative judgements, and any other metrics as the task organizers see fit. You accept that the ultimate decision of metric choice and score value is that of the task organizers. Organizers are under no obligation to release scores. Official scores may be withheld if organizers judge the submission incomplete, erroneous, deceptive, or violating the letter or spirit of the competition's rules. Inclusion of a submission's scores is not an endorsement of a team or individual's submission, system, or science. If multiple submission files are uploaded during the Test Phase, the last submission file per group will be understood as the team's or participant's definitive submission and ranked as such in the task description paper.

**Data usage**: The provided data should be used responsibly and ethically. Do not attempt to misuse it in any way, including, but not limited to, reconstructing test sets, any none-scientific use of the data, or any other unconscionable usage of the data. You may not redistribute the task data except in the manner prescribed by its licence.

**Submission of systems description papers**: Participants having made at least one submission during the Test Phase will be invited to submit a paper describing their system. We strongly encourage a link to the code of systems being described will be made available to organizers or the public at large. We also encourage you to upload any systems and models to an open-source repository such as the HuggingFace Hub.

**Specific conditions for closed tasks**: Participants agree to use no (i) existing models trained on additional data labelled for sexism or misogyny or (ii) additional data labelled for sexism or misogyny.

**Specific conditions for open tasks**: If participants use additional models or embeddings trained on data labelled for sexism or misogyny, these models and data need to be open source and provided by the participants upon request. Participating in the closed task is a precondition to participate in the open task. However, participating in the open task is no precondition for participating in the closed task.
